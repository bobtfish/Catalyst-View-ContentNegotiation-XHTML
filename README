NAME
    Catalyst::View::ContentNegotiation::XHTML - Adjusts the response
    Content-Type header to application/xhtml+xml if the browser accepts it.

SYNOPSIS
        package Catalyst::View::TT;

        use Moose;
        use namespace::clean -except => 'meta';

        extends qw/Catalyst::View::TT/;
        with qw/Catalyst::View::ContentNegotiation::XHTML/;

        1;

DESCRIPTION
    This is a simple Role which sets the response "Content-Type" to be
    "application/xhtml+xml" if the users browser sends an "Accept" header
    indicating that it is willing to process that MIME type.

    Changing the "Content-Type" to "application/xhtml+xml" causes browsers
    to interpret the page as XML, meaning that your markup must be well
    formed.

CAVEATS
    This is useful when you're developing your application, as you know that
    all pages you view are parsed as XML, so any errors caused by your
    markup not being well-formed will show up at once.

    Whilst this module is has been tested against most popular browsers
    including Internet Explorer, it may cause unexpected results on browsers
    which do not properly support the "application/xhtml+xml" MIME type.

METHOD MODIFIERS
  after process
    Changes the response "Content-Type" if appropriate (from the requests
    "Accept" header).

METHODS
  pragmatic_accept
    Some browsers (such as Internet Explorer) have a nasty way of sending
    Accept */* and this claiming to support XHTML just as well as HTML.
    Saving to a file on disk or opening with another application does count
    as accepting, but it really should have a lower q value then text/html.
    This sub takes a pragmatic approach and corrects this mistake by
    modifying the Accept header before passing it to content negotiation.

ATTRIBUTES
  variants
    Returns an array ref of 3 part arrays, comprising name, priority, output
    mime-type, which is used for the content negotiation algorithm.

PRIVATE METHODS
  _build_variants
    Returns the default variant attribute contents.

BUGS
    Should be split into a base ContentNegotiation role which is consumed by
    ContentNegotiation::XHTML.
