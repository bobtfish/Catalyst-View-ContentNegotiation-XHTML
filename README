NAME
    Catalyst::View::TT::XHTML - A sub-class of the standard TT view which
    serves application/xhtml+xml content if the browser accepts it.

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp::View::XHTML;
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use base qw/Catalyst::View::TT::XHTML MyApp::View::TT/;
    
        1;
    
DESCRIPTION
    This is a very simple sub-class of Catalyst::View::TT, which sets the
    response "Content-Type" to be "application/xhtml+xml" if the user's
    browser sends an "Accept" header indicating that it is willing to
    process that MIME type.

    Changing the "Content-Type" causes browsers to interpret the page as
    strict XHTML, meaning that the markup must be well formed.

    This is useful when you're developing your application, as you know that
    all pages you view are rendered strictly, so any markup errors will show
    up at once.

METHODS
  process
    Overrides the standard process method, delegating to Catalyst::View::TT
    to render the template, and then changing the response "Content-Type" if
    appropriate (from the requests "Accept" header).

BUGS
    There should be a more elegant way to inherit the config of your normal
    TT view.

    Configuration (as loaded by Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader) for the TT
    view is not used.

    No helper to generate the view file needed (just copy the code in the
    SYNOPSIS).
